Hello World!

I'm Madi. I'm a [first-principles](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/ "First-Principles Thinking") type of thinker and I'm what Filipinos call a [siraniko](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=siraniko "Siraniko, the tinkerer"). I take things apart, re-engineer them and ultimately, make them 200x better.

I like working on technical problems where I'm able to own the product development, end-to-end. Give me a tough problem the team had been stuck on solving for years, I'll hack my way to get over the learning curve (no matter how steep) and deliver a straw-man solution, a.k.a. [a working MVP within a month.](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/ "Minimum Viable Product")

Recently, I've been working on projects in automotive, wireless communications and technopreneurship. 

Looking to add a cool AF product engineer on your team? You can reach me at masdimaisip@gmail.com

Just keep hacking!
