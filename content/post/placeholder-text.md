# REBOOT: Renewable Energy Boot Camp for Young Engineers

Renewable Energy Bootcamp for Young Engineers [(REBOOT)](https://www.fes-philippines.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/REBOOT_3/REBOOT_-_Batch_3_Call_for_Applications.pdf) is an initiative from UP-Diliman, with the assistance of Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) and other partner non- government organizations (NGOs). The final output of this program is an idea pitch from the participantsâ€™ proposed renewable energy projects for the benefit of poor communities in Aurora, Quezon.

While at the bootcamp, I took initiative in handling all administrative and logistical concerns of the solar energy training. I was also responsible for the equipment set-up and troubleshooting technical issues during the event. 

Given my experience in electronics engineering, I guided the participants with the use of tools and electrical wiring while also keeping technical and events documentation of the on-going workshops.
