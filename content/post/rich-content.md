# **Shell Eco-marathon x Electricals**

You know you're in for a wild ride when you get onboarded on a race-car building team less than a month before the race.

> In a true "build-from-scratch" fashion, I learned skills and topics ranging from electronic fuel injection down to proper wire organization. I took a hands-on approach, probing nodes and soldering circuits myself to make sure all electrical devices are working as intended and overall safety of the vehicle is never compromised.

As part of the first few members of the team, I was accountable for the design, procurement, development, installation, testing and debugging of all the electrical aspects of our vehicle, [Alamat UP](https://www.bworldonline.com/shell-eco-marathon-asia-shows-way-to-energy-future/ "Alamat UP").

Eventually, we did get the car up-and-running, complete with all the electrical system it needs - including kickass LED headlights and a very loud electrical car horn.

We travelled to the main event at Sepang International Circuit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where I was part of the **pit crew** for the electrical maintenance of the vehicle during the race.

By stepping up, I became the acting head for the electricals team during the event which led to becoming the committee head for Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2020.
