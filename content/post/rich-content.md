# **Shell Eco-marathon x Electricals**

You know you're in for a wild ride when you get onboarded on a race-car building team less than a month before the race.

> In a true "build-from-scratch" fashion, I learned skills and topics ranging from electronic fuel injection down to proper wire organization. I took a hands-on approach, probing nodes and soldering circuits myself to make sure all electrical devices are working as intended and overall safety of the vehicle is never compromised.

As part of the first few members of the team, I was accountable for the design, procurement, development, testing and debugging of all the electrical aspects of [Alamat UP](https://www.bworldonline.com/shell-eco-marathon-asia-shows-way-to-energy-future/ "Alamat UP").

Eventually, we did get the car up-and-running, complete with all the electrical system it needs - kickass LED
