The Plastic 3R Hacks PH Grand Finalists were announced last Friday, and our team (Team STP) did not make the list. To our surprise, we got a call from the organizers yesterday - one team backed out so, we're back in the game.

Being that we're a wildcard barely making it to the prelims, I had already changed shirts and went back to work after the pitch. Lo and behold, from placing 11th, Team STP emerged as the first Grand winner of Plastic (3R) Hacks PH!
