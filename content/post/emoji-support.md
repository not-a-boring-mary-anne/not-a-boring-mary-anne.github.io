# Engineers Without Borders

When I was looking for opportunities to volunteer, my main areas of interest were Humanitarian Engineering, Entrepreneurship (for social good) and Design. Engineers Without Borders existed at the intersection of these and was the perfect platform to use my technical capabilities to develop tech-enabled solutions for **Geographically Isolated and** **Disadvantaged Areas** (GIDA).

As a member of EWB, I was involved in the organization's overall operations and finance committee. In addition to that, I volunteered @ [SOLAR Hope](https://www.facebook.com/SOLARHopeMovement/), or Sustainable Outreach and Lifelong Advocacy to Rekindle Hope, a team that develops communities and transform them into ‘beacons of hope’. We visited the poor communities to cultivate sustainable solutions through a participatory approach. One notable experience is the outreach (we hand-built some furniture for the school sitting on top of a mountain!) and quality-of-life survey with the Bajao community in Rawang, Rizal.

I hiked with a group of engineers and architects to the top of the mountain where the elementary school is located, set-up the solar devices to be used as a light source in the school (this remote area is completely unelectrified) then held trainings for the locals on how to keep these light sources up-and-running.

Another volunteer project we worked on was with a community in Coloong, Valenzuela - where we introduced a low-cost alternative to setting up an[ aquaponics](https://www.permaculturenews.org/2016/05/30/what-is-aquaponics-and-how-does-it-work/#:\~:text=Aquaponics%20is%20a%20combination%20of,aquatic%20animals'%20discharge%20or%20waste.) system. The fresh produce-harvest and the fish raised from the pond has helped the community gain an additional source of income.
