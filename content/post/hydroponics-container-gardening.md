# Hydroponics & Container Gardening

Outside of work, I like to experiment with growing herbs, leafy greens, and fruits on soil, through kratky method or NFT. I especially enjoy data logging to keep track of our nutrient dose-adjustments' effect to the overall yield.

We also built our own full-spectrum lighting system and IoT lighting & water pump control using Arduino and relays.

Some of our successful harvests include:

* Lettuce (parris island, romaine, red rapids, iceberg)
* Basil (spice glove & sweet basil)
* Pechay (pak-choi)
* Mustard leaves (mustasa)
* Calamansi
* Atis plant (sugar apple)
* Chilli
* Kangkong (water spinach)
* Papaya
* Dill

We haven't had much success with root crops or fruits like labanos (radish) or tomatoes (we've tried to grow several varieties, still no edible harvest).

For every failed experiment we had, we were able to enjoy countless plates of lettuce-tomato salads and used fresh-harvest lettuce when we cook samgyup at home.
