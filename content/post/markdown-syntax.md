# Agile & Human-Centered Design

As an Innovation Research Center affiliate, one of our sprints include identifying a business problem that can be solved by technology.  I looked into several case studies and developed an end-to-end proposal (market validation to [Hi-Fi MVP](https://www.seedrs.com/academy/discover-the-4-types-of-minimum-viable-product/ "Hi-Fi")) for a wireless communication device to be used in cargo ships. 

## User Story

From the farm to your refrigerator, or the factory to your wardrobe, A.P. Moller - Maersk is developing solutions that meet customer needs from one end of the supply chain to the other. 

To understand the challenges the company faces in Transportation Services, specifically, Ocean Transport (container shipping), I interviewed an Overseas Marine Engineer working on one of their cargo ships. 

## Day-in-the-life

As an on-board engineer, Engr. Gutierrez spends most of his time going around the cargo ship to conduct inspections, maintenance and repair on each shipping container, making sure that everything remains safe and quality of cargo is never compromised (e.g. temperature doesn't go below the threshold, there are no damages or holes in any container, etc).

Maersk moves 12 million containers to and fro 300 ports around the world, which means at any given time, a cargo ship carries hundreds of shipping containers - all requiring regular inspection and maintenance while in transit.

This process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, one of the most pressing challenges while onboard is **communication.**

## Value Proposition

To address this problem, I proposed a wireless communication network to be used on the ship where there is no internet or cellular network connection. The proposal includes the use of Zigbee low-power wireless mesh networks.
